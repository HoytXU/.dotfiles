## Set up
I'm using Ubuntu20.04 in my WSL system, and I'll take this system as the standard setting up. 
1. go to your root directory
cd ~

2. clone this dotfile git
git clone https://github.com/HoytXU/.dotfiles.git
# when you clone a repository with moduels, you have to do this 
git submodule update --init --recursive

3. install
just run ./install inside the .dotfiles directory.
